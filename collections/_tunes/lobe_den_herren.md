LOBE DEN HERREN first appeared anonymously in Ander Theil Des Erneuerten Gesang-Buchs* (1665), where it was set to Ahasverus Fritsch’s “Hast du denn, Liebster, dein Angesicht gänzlich verborgen.” Its name comes from the association with the text in Neander’s collection cited above. The setting is from The Hymnal (1982), while the descant by Craig Sellar Lang is from the Episcopal hymnal Hymns for Church and School (1964).
